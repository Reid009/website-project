    <p>
      Lacrosse is the fastest growing sport in the United States. Lacrosse has 4 positions, goalie, defense, midfield, and attack.
      Our school has a Lacrosse team with aorund 50 players that will start playing in the spring.
      The role of the goalie is to block shots coming from the opposing team.
      The role of the defense is to do everything in his power to either get the ball from the oppsing player, or push him out of bounds.
      The role of midfielders is to playe both offense and defense and be a supporting role for the specialists on each side.
      The role of attacks is to score goals and be a quick as possible.
